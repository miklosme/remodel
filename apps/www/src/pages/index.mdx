## Moore's Law for Developer Productivity {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

Over the past few years, developer productivity has seen significant improvements, thanks to the rapid advancements in technology and programming tools. In fact, it is estimated that

<blockquote>
  every three years, it becomes 50% easier to write the same software,
</blockquote>

allowing developers to create more complex and feature-rich applications in a shorter amount of time.

However, this incredible growth in productivity primarily benefits greenfield projects, where developers can take full advantage of the latest tools and frameworks without the constraints of legacy code or existing systems.

## Time for AI-assisted code refactor {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

Introducing Remodel, a revolutionary AI-based developer tool that helps engineers refactor their old web applications to new technology stacks, while retaining their essential functionality. This is incredibly useful for companies who rely on applications that generate significant revenue, but are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain due to their outdated tech stacks.

By modernizing these applications, companies can reap the benefits of faster development cycles, easier talent acquisition, and an improved ability to keep up with the ever-changing expectations of web-based features.

## Automated testing is key {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

As we look towards the future of AI-generated code, we need to ensure that the software our AI creates is not only functional but also of high quality. To achieve this, we must guide the AI by providing it with automated tests that it can use to validate its generated code.

Developing a solution that quickly creates automated tests for old projects is a challenge, as it is often tedious and time-consuming to improve test code coverage. However, by providing these tests, we can let the AI iterate on its code based on the test results, while also offering valuable data that will help the AI generate better code in the future.

## Why did I start Remodel? {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

Throughout my career, I have seen first-hand the immense value that exists in legacy software, as well as the challenges that come with upgrading components in older applications. This experience has led me to envision a world where transitioning to new foundational technologies is fast, affordable, and safe.

By creating Remodel, I hope to unlock the hidden potential in these legacy applications and enable companies to fully leverage the advances in AI code generation, creating a brighter and more efficient future for software development.
