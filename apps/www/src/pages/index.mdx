## Moore's Law for Developer Productivity {{ date: '2023-05-06T00:00Z' }}

As most things in tech, software developer productivity is also in a constantly improving state. In web development, it's a common source of comedy to joke about the strugle of keeping up with all the new advancements. In fact, it is estimated that

<blockquote>
  every three years, it becomes 50% easier to write the same software.
</blockquote>

This enables developers to create more complex and feature-rich user experiences exponentionally cheaper.

However, this remarkable growth in productivity primarily benefits new projects. Older software often becomes buried under layers of technical debt, as rewriting code is a time-consuming and laborious task.

- Revitalizing older software is a powerful way to unlock hidden value
- Mature projects have proven product-market fit, making investments in them low-risk and high-return
- Refining older projects can be viewed as starting a new one but from a solid foundation

## AI-Assisted Code Refactoring: A Game Changer {{ date: '2023-05-02T00:00Z' }}

As we look towards the future of AI-generated code, we need to understand the limitations of relying solely on a Large Language Model (LLM). A zero-shot approach might not produce output that satisfies all criteria. Features could be lost, and functionalities could mutate in the process, as the language model generates imperfect results.

We propose a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that would define the requirements of the original software, acting as a specification that the AI solution could consult. This DSL would be similar to an automated software testing language, but it would focus solely on program requirements (as opposed to testing languages that also address implementation details). This approach would enable us to build a companion solution that helps human engineers quickly map out all the functionalities of a given software.

## The Importance of Better Software Testing {{ date: '2023-04-28T00:00Z' }}

As we look towards the future of AI-generated code, we need to understand the limitations of purely depending on a Large Language Model. A zero shot approach would probably not produce an output, that satisfies all criterias. Features could be lost, functionalities could mutate in the process, as the language model creates imperfect results.

With Remodel, I propose an a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that would define the requirements of the original software, and would act as a spcification that the AI solution could consult. This SDL would be similar as an automated software testing language, but it would only focus on the program requirements (as opposite to testing languages, that also focus on implementation details). This approach lets us to build a companion solution, that would enable human engineers to quickly map out all the functionality that a given software have.

### <SparkleIcon className="animate-pulse-color from-yellow-500 to-blue-400" /> This DSL could be...

- ...generated through session recording. A manual tester performs the expected tasks, and the underlying software behavior is recorded as the DSL.
- ...acting as an intermediary between multiple developer tools, functioning as a protocol to compose various AI tools together.
- ...being human-readable, which helps technical teams review and reason about existing functionalities and communicate expected behavior after the refactor.

## Why I Started Remodel {{ date: '2023-04-27T00:00Z' }}

Throughout my career, I have seen first-hand the immense value that exists in legacy software, as well as the challenges that come with upgrading components in older applications. Sometimes, I refer to myself as a Software Archaeologist because I have always been that person in my various teams, who undertakes digging up old libraries, and figuring out the optimal way to upgrade. I'm biased toward improving software and fixing long standing issues.

That's why I'm incredibly excited about using AI to fix softwareâ€”all software. This is a historic moment for the software industry, with numerous problems waiting to be solved, developer tools with immense impact emerging, and end-users ultimately benefiting from vastly superior experiences compared to what we have today.

### <SparkleIcon className="animate-pulse-color from-yellow-500 to-blue-400" /> Questions I'm Eager to Explore

- How can we leverage LLMs to rapidly convert existing systems to adopt new technologies?
- What does an AI-native developer tool look like?
- What kind of consumer software will we have when productivity increases 100-fold?
