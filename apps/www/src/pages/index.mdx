## Moore's Law for Developer Productivity {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

As most things in tech, software developer productivity is also in a constantly improving state. In web development, it's a common source of comedy to joke about the strugle of keeping up with all the new advancements. In fact, it is estimated that

<blockquote>
  every three years, it becomes 50% easier to write the same software,
</blockquote>

allowing developers to create more complex and feature-rich applications in a shorter amount of time.

However, this incredible growth in productivity primarily benefits newly started projects. Older software often gets left behind, as rewriting code is very labour intensive.

### <SparkleIcon className="animate-pulse-color from-yellow-500 to-blue-400" /> Answers I'm looking for

- How can we use LLMs to rapidly convert existing systems to use a new technology?
- How does an AI-native developer tool look like?
- What kind of consumer software will we have, when productivity will 100x?

## AI-assisted code refactor will change everything {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

Traditional code refactoring, a labor-intensive aspect of software development, has been challenging for developers with tight deadlines and budget constraints. However, AI-assisted code refactor will enable more sweeping code changes while minimizing errors, introduce faster adoption of new technologies, and improve software quality.

By automating the refactoring process and handling technical debt more efficiently, AI tools will empower developers to focus on critical tasks, maintain clean and efficient code, and contribute to a more agile software ecosystem. This fundamental shift to AI-assisted code refactoring promises substantial impact on the industry, streamlining software development and addressing long-standing limitations.

## Better software testing is key {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

As we look towards the future of AI-generated code, we need to ensure that the software our AI creates is not only functional but also of high quality. To achieve this, we must guide the AI by providing it with automated tests that it can use to validate its generated code.

Developing a solution that quickly creates automated tests for old projects is a challenge, as it is often tedious and time-consuming to improve test code coverage. However, by providing these tests, we can let the AI iterate on its code based on the test results, while also offering valuable data that will help the AI generate better code in the future.

## Why did I start Remodel? {{ date: '2023-04-06T00:00Z' }}

Throughout my career, I have seen first-hand the immense value that exists in legacy software, as well as the challenges that come with upgrading components in older applications. This experience has led me to envision a world where transitioning to new foundational technologies is fast, affordable, and safe.

By creating Remodel, I hope to unlock the hidden potential in these legacy applications and enable companies to fully leverage the advances in AI code generation, creating a brighter and more efficient future for software development.
